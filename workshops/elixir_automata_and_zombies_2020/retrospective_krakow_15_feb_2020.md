# Retrospective

## How do you feel about the workshop?

* "Too short."
* "Slow start."
    * "The introduction was nice but we could have started with more practical stuff."
* "We could have started with talking about how we're going to solve the problem, then started writing the code."
    * "We are not used to the words plot and census."
    * "Plot isn't best word, more like coordinates."
    * "Meaning of plot is overloaded."
    * "Census as population or something like that?"
* "I like the way you make sure everyone feels good enough to participate and welcome to take part."
* "I like the language details."
* "I liked seeing the different ways of doing the same things."
* "Post a tl;dr for the basic syntax, boost how quickly we can go through the stuff. We could prepare ourselves. Some preparatory materials."
* "I like the idea of mob programming instead of pair programming."

## How do you feel about your code?

* "Ugly."
    * "No, it's simple, it works."
* "Many ways you can write the code."
* "We tried one approach and it didn't work, then we tried another and it did but I don't know why the first one didn't work."
* "Hard to decode what the tests are actually doing and then writing the functions."
* "It's fun."

## What to try differently?

* "Maybe fill in the blanks for a couple things, maybe with git checkpoints? If you get stuck you can continue and / or look at the solution?"
* "Tests that are written and provided, and then we write to code to pass the tests?"
    * "May we write one test together first?"
