# Retrospective

## What went well

* "I think the mob programming part went really well. I never tried it before and worried it would be weird. I think it went really well and working with other people helped me understand things better."
* "I think it's amazing how much we covered, from first principals to writing tests and refactoring."
* "TDD works really well."
* "Your tips were really helpful and it wasn't so big and obvious so we have a place to think for ourself and grow."
* "Rules of mob programming. The rules are very good."
    * "I already see myself applying them to my regular work life. Saying stuff like 'yes and' will be very useful."
* "I like that you talked about some technical things like arity and pure functions, more theoretical than practical. It was nice you mentioned some things that can be applied. It's not only practical but offers ideas from computer science."
    * "Like history and people."
    * "I was like 'why is he so over-excited'? And then I was like so excited too."
* "I had good support from my boss to be here. My manager is very supportive."
* "The location was cool because I came by bus and it was easy to get here."
* "I got kinda excited about the idea of functional programming. Eight hours ago I didn't know much about functional programming, and now I'm looking forward to learning more."
* "I tried to dive into Elixir before. It's much better when you try to do it with other people and hear about it. Maybe the first part was slow, but even that was an opportunity to help me shift paradigms."

## What didn't go so well

* "I didn't make up my mind beforehand if I was participating in the class or not, so I was jumping in and out."

## What should we try differently?

* "The beginning part, the most basic part, was important but we could have gone though that faster. The course is short, so I would have liked to focus on functions and more difficult parts."
* "I think that smaller mobs might be better."
    * "I think that three people was just about perfect."
    * "I think it was good to switch drivers more often."
* "It would be nice to have a break in the afternoon session. It gets really intense and it would have been nice to have a short coffee break."
* "Maybe have a repository so we can what is the final result so we can see how the problem is solved?"
